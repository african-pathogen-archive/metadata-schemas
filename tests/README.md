This folder contains some test data with:
1. Both `consensus_sequence` and `cholgen_sequence` schemas expanded (using the [merge-schema.py](https://github.com/african-pathogen-archive/muse-schema-test/blob/main/merge-schema.py) tool).
2. Example JSON files that validate against these schemas (built using the [tsv_prep.py](https://github.com/african-pathogen-archive/muse-schema-test/blob/main/tsv_prep.py) tool with some hand-editing)

It also contains some small files in TSV and FASTA format for testing muse.
